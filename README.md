Kaltura-LinuxPrepScripts
========================

A few Bash scripts I wrote to prepare Linux cloud instances for the installation of Kaltura Community Edition 4.0
(http://www.kaltura.org/project/community_edition_video_platform)

These scripts assume that there will only be one server running Community Edition.
